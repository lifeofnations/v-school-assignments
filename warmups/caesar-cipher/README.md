Made a function that would shift the letters of a string like a caesar cipher. I had to not change
whitespace and special characters or numbers in the string as well. I solved it and presented and 
walked though my answer in front of the class. While solving it perfectly within the given paramaters. I learned
that I could use a % to get rid of a few lines of code and make it more scalable.
