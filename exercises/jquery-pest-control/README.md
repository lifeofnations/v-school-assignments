I created a web page for Mario and his pest controll buisness. It needed to be styled well and have a header
nav bar and footer as well as images for each of the 3 baddie types. the only thing that couldn't be 
hard coded was the toal price, however I decided to make the number of baddies smashed an imput that could
be changed. So in the end the totals for each baddie and the total price was determined by the .js file
and was not hardcoded.
